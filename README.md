# Genomic Analysis

This repository contains the genomic analysis code accompanying the study titled "XIST loss induces variable transcriptional responses dependent on cell states."

## Overview

The analyses provided here are designed to investigate the transcriptional consequences of XIST loss across different cell types, species and states. The repository includes scripts and data essential for reproducing the key findings of the study.

## Repository Structure

- **Analyze the relationship between X-linked DEGs and XCI status**: Investigate how XIST deficiency derived differentially expressed genes (DEGs) on the X chromosome correlate with X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) status (XCI escape or inactive genes).
- **Calculate TPM of XIST expression level**: Compute Transcripts Per Million (TPM) values for comparing the XIST expression level among different cell types and species.
- **Correlation between X-linked DEG and all X-linked genes**: Analyze the correlation between X-linked DEGs (after XIST loss) and the broader density set of all X-linked genes.
- **Correlation between X-linked DEGs and LINE or SINE**: Examination of the association between X-linked DEGs and Long Interspersed Nuclear Elements (LINEs) or Short Interspersed Nuclear Elements (SINEs).
- **Cumulative Distribution Fraction Plot**: Scripts to generate cumulative distribution fraction plots for various analyses.
- **X-linked DEG distribution along X**: Visualization of the distribution of X-linked DEGs across the X chromosome.
- **Z test for percentage of DEGs**: Statistical analysis comparing the percentage of DEGs between different groups.
- **Correlation of the X-linked DEGs between different cells**: Analysis of how X-linked DEGs correlate across various cell types.

## Data

The `Useful_files` directory contains essential data files for the analyses:

'Control_X7_X9_counts.txt' is the count data our lab generated from XIST knockdown OVCAR3 (GSE271117)
'counts_data_MaSC.txt' and 'counts_data_ML.txt' are the count data generated from XIST knockout human mammary cells (GSE159946)
'counts_hESC.txt' is the count data generated from XIST knockout human ESCs (GSE241444)
'counts_Lin_F.txt', 'counts_LSK_F.txt', 'counts_LK_F.txt' and 'counts_MEF', are the count data for Xist-deficiency Lin-, LSK+, LSK- cells and MEF respectively, which are shared by the Yildirim group.
'resX7_hg38.txt', 'resX9_hg38.txt', 'resMaSC_v19.txt', 'resML_v19.txt', 'resESC_KO_C7.txt', 'resESC_KO_C18.txt' and 'resMEF_mm10.txt' are generated by analyzing count data using DESeq2.
'DEG_Lin.txt', 'DEG_LSK.txt' and 'DEG_LK.txt' are DEG lists of mouse Lin-, LSK+ and LSK- cells generated from the published Supplementary Data (Yang et al. 2022)
